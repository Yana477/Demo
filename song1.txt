Only thing that keeps us apart
Is seven thousand miles, running like a mad dog
Only thing that keeps us apart
Is a different timezone
So fuck what I'm dreaming, this fame has no meaning
I'm coming home
Only thing that keeps us apart
Is a different timezone
Tomorrow, I got another plane, I'm not gonna take it
Mm, instead, I'm gonna fly straight to you, I paid double for the tickets
And I don't give a shit about the contracts that I signed
And they can say whatever, we'll be making love, I'm fucking you tonight
